This is a pytorch implementation of Full resolution residual network of paper [Full-Resolution Residual Networks for Semantic Segmentation in Street Scenes](https://https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.08323)

It's noticeable that full resolution residual network(FRRN) uses lots of unpool layer. However,  in pytorch unpool must be coupled with pooling index, so i use a hacking method to circumvent this.
